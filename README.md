# ReleaseManager
Release Manager is a Release and Patching tool for any software project. Release Manager takes the uncertainty out of patching your software projects, leaving you to focus on the features in your product and not the hassle of distribution.

## Please be patient.
Currently we are reworking the source code to be GPL some files included are not suitable for distribution and have to be removed.
