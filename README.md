# ReleaseManager

Release Manager is a Release and Patching tool for any software project. Release Manager takes the uncertainty out of patching your software projects, leaving you to focus on the features in your product and not the hassle of distribution.

## Please be patient

Currently we are reworking the source code to be GPL some files included are not suitable for distribution and have to be removed.

## Why open source

We value Release Manager but as a company Celestial is moving forward to focus on game development rather then tools as it's business. By making Release Manager open source we can support it easier as it removes the commercial effort and lets us only focus on the product.

We use Release Manager for our own projects so another value from making it open source is more testing. This will help us be certain that it is more stable.

## Discussion and support

We are centralizing all our online support through Discord. There is an open chanel [here](https://discord.gg/SsNpTg).

## Perks for people that bought Release Manager

We are considering perks for those who in fact bought Release Manager while it was commercial. Please send some suggestions if you have some.
